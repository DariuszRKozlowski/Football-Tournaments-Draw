In UEFA European Championship take part 24 countries from European federation.
Before the draw teams are divided into 4 pots (6 national teams per each pot).
To the first pot goes:
- National team of tournament host country,
- National teams from countries with the biggest Country UEFA Coefficient*.

Teams into other pots are allocated only by Country UEFA Coefficient.
From pot 1 to pot 4, each team from single pot goes to one group from A to F**.

By political issues, in the same group can not play together national teams of:
a) Russia and Ukraine,
b) Russia and Kosovo, 
c) Spain and Gibraltar, 
d) Armenia and Azerbaijan,
e) Kosovo and Bosnia & Herzegovina,
f) Kosovo and Serbia.

*If host country national team has also one of the biggest Country UEFA Coefficient,
its place in pot is taken by national team with the next biggest coefficient.
** Host country is automatically allocated to group A.
